### Hi ! ⚡️

My name is Enzo and I'm learning to be the developer you want to work with.

I'm a super energetic person who:

💻 codes a lot  
🍳 eats a lot  
🏋🏻‍♂️ trains a lot

I have been doing web development for the last 10 years bootstrapping +50 products in a wide variety of markets 🚀

Currently leading frontend at [chance.co](https://www.chance.co) and pushing my life project [toptile.life](https://toptile.life) 🎯
