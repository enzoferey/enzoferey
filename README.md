### Hi ! ⚡️

My name is Enzo and I'm learning to be the developer you want to work with.

I'm a super energetic person who:

💻 codes a lot  
🍳 eats a lot  
🏋🏻‍♂️ trains a lot

I have been doing web development for the last 10 years bootstrapping +50 products in a wide variety of markets 🚀

Currently looking for new opportunities as both freelance and full time employee, write me at hello@enzoferey.com 🎯
